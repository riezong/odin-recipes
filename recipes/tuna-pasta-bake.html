    <!-- Description -->
    <p>Ahh, tuna bake. Where would we be without it? Ticking all the boxes: simple, budget-friendly, family friendly and made from at-hand ingredients, this tuna bake recipe’s one of my favourites.</p>

    <p><h2>What we love about this tuna bake recipe</h2></p>
    
    <p>It’s carby, creamy and cheesy but with a couple of substitutes that creates a better-for-you version. This is a tuna bake for all the family. There are no vegetables for the fussy eaters, but you can serve it with a salad or a bowl of steamed greens. I love the way the tiny flakes of tuna find their way into the macaroni pasta and that it’s on the table in just over half an hour. This tuna bake also freezes perfectly and is excellent eaten hot or cold the next day for lunch.</p>
